# Cotton Disease Prediction

Cotton Disease Prediction is a supervised machine learning project that utilizes deep learning techniques to predict diseases in cotton plants. The project employs transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture using the Sequential API.

## Overview

Cotton Disease Prediction aims to identify diseases in cotton plants using deep learning models. The project explores various deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, and more. After extensive experimentation, ResNet50 emerged as the most effective model in terms of accuracy and test loss, considering efficiency and computational power trade-offs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains images of cotton plants affected by various diseases, along with healthy cotton plants for comparison.

## Models Explored

- **ResNet50**: A deep residual network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
- **VGG16**: A convolutional neural network architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness.


## Why ResNet50?

Among the different models explored, ResNet50 demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and test loss. Additionally, ResNet50 strikes a balance between computational power and efficiency, making it the optimal choice for this project.
